# Topology Master Code

This repository contains scripts for calculating and analyzing dynamic and static brain connectivity based on datasets. The following files are included:

## File Descriptions

- **main.py**: The main entry point for running the calculation.
  
- **calculate.py**: Computes dynamic and static brain connectivity and structural information based on the dataset.

- **dynamic.py**: Integrates brain connectivity structural information from the dataset.

- **result_struct.py**: Provides detailed structural information derived from the analysis.

- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for binarizing data.

## Usage

To run the analysis, execute the `main.py` file. Ensure that all dependencies are installed and that the necessary datasets are available in the appropriate directory.

```bash
python main.py
